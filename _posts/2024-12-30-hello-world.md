## Welcome to Neurohard

This is a test post to see how things look. If you're reading this, the blog is working.

Soon I'll be writing about:

- Web development experiments with Next.js and Spring Boot
- Retro Japanese computing (PC-88, PC-98, X68000, MSX, PC-Engine...)
- Remaking classic games with Unity
- Cyberpunk culture and pulp fiction
- Japanese language and culture

Stay tuned.

```javascript
// Just testing code blocks
console.log("Hello from Neurohard");
```

## A test image

If I add images later, they'll go in `/assets/img/posts/` and look something like this:
