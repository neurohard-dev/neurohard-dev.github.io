# Hey, I'm Manuel

I'm a software developer from Spain. I work with enterprise systems professionally, and in my spare time I enjoy building personal projects and exploring the fringes of tech and culture.

## What I do here

This blog is a space for my personal projects, experiments, and interests:

- **Web development**: Next.js, Spring Boot, and whatever catches my attention
- **Retro Japanese computing**: PC-Engine, PC-88/98, MSX, X68000, and other fascinating machines from the 80s and 90s
- **Game remakes**: Recreating classic Japanese games with modern engines
- **Cyberpunk & pulp fiction**: Lovecraft, Gibson, and everything in between
- **Japan & Japanese**: The language, the culture, the aesthetic

## Why "Neurohard"?

Named after a lost Masamune Shirow project that never saw the light — the original material was destroyed in a flood. A fitting name for a blog about recovering old tech and unfinished ideas.
