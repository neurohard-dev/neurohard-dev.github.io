# Hey, I'm Manuel

I'm a software developer from Spain. By day I work with enterprise systems, but my real passion lies elsewhere: building things, breaking things, and exploring the fringes of tech and culture.

## What I do here

This blog is a dump of my personal projects, experiments, and obsessions:

- **Web development**: Next.js, Spring Boot, and whatever catches my attention
- **Retro Japanese computing**: PC-Engine, PC-88/98, MSX, X68000, and other forgotten machines from the 80s and 90s
- **Game remakes**: Taking old Japanese games and rebuilding them with modern engines like Unity
- **Cyberpunk & pulp fiction**: Lovecraft, Gibson, and everything in between
- **Japan & Japanese**: The language, the culture, the aesthetic

## Why "Neurohard"?

A nod to *Neuromancer*, a jab at certain software companies, and a reminder that brains should be tough. Take it however you like.
